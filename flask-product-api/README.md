The Product Management REST API is a lightweight, flexible solution for managing product resources built with Flask, designed to provide simple yet powerful endpoint interactions for creating and retrieving products with comprehensive validation and error handling. Developers can quickly set up the project by cloning the repository, creating a virtual environment, installing dependencies like Flask and requests, and running the API server, which supports key endpoints for product creation and retrieval with built-in input validation ensuring that only well-formed product data is accepted. The API handles various scenarios including successful product creation (201 status), invalid input rejection (400 status), and includes robust error management to provide clear, actionable feedback for API consumers.
